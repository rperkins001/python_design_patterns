"""Adapter (Structural Pattern):
The Adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is useful when you want to create a bridge between two incompatible interfaces without modifying their source code."""

class Target:
    def request(self):
        return "Target: The default target's behavior."

class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self):
        return ".eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS"

class Adapter(Target):
    def __init__(self, adaptee):
        self.adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self):
        return f"Adapter: (TRANSLATED) {self.adaptee.specific_request()[::-1]}"

adaptee = Adaptee()
adapter = Adapter(adaptee)
print(adapter.request())  # Output: Adapter: (TRANSLATED) Special behavior of the Adaptee.

"""Explanation:
In this example, the Target class has a request method that returns a string. The Adaptee class has a specific_request method with a different signature, and it returns a reversed string. The Adapter class, which inherits from Target, takes an instance of Adaptee as input and overrides the request method to call the specific_request method of Adaptee and then reverse the result."""
